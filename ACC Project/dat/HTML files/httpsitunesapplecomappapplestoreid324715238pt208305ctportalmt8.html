          <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First of all, I love this app. It is very professionally made. The UI is clean and intuitive. Links work how you’d expect them to, it’s easy to search, navigate through pages and find words within articles. But there is one major glitch that makes me extremely frustrated - editing documents. For some reason the cursor is virtually unusable when editing documents. It jumps around and sometimes just gets stuck in place making it impossible to set it where you want to begin typing. There are other problems with it that I won’t get into but really the only flaw of this app id the editing UI. This app would be absolutely PERFECT if that is fixed.<br><br>But if you don’t edit pages like I do, you’ll absolutely love this app! Think of all the FREE information you’re getting from this app. Truly mind-boggling the world that we live in.</p> <!---->

          <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After writing this, i will have deleted the app in favour of the website. This is for one reason: convenience, its way easier to find and go to a specific part of an article on the site rather then the app. Let’s use the page on, Visby Sweden as an example. On the website, when you scroll down below the general information, you get headers like: “etymology”, “history”, “climate”, and “infrastructure”, you can then tap on one or more of these things to open that/those specific section(s). On the app, you cannot do this. Let’s say i want to get to the “infrastructure” section, i now have to scroll down through the “etymology” through “climate” sections of the article just to get to the section I want to read. Why, why isn’t the app like the mobile version of the website? <br><br>I have checked the settings to see if this was something i had to turn on, I couldn’t find it, either i am missing something (if so deepest apologies) or this simple feature doesn’t exist.<br><br>Kindest regards - Fluffysheep</p> <!---->
