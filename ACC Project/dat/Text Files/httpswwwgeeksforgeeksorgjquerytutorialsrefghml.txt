 output: why to use jquery? some of the key points that support the answer for why to use jquery: it helps us to manipulate html and css it helps us to manipulate dom (document object model) elements provides event methods to trigger and respond to an events on a html page such as mouse click, keypress etc. implements ajax calls. using jquery (javascript library) on html page: there are several ways to start using it on your website. use the google-hosted/microsoft-hosted content delivery network (cdn) to include a version. or download it from official website jquery.com and host it on your server or local filesystem. advantages: wide range of plug-ins that allows developers to create plug-ins on top of the javascript library. large development community. it is a lot easier to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries. it lets users develop ajax templates with ease. ajax enables a sleeker interface where actions can be performed on pages without requiring the entire page to be reloaded. being light weight and a powerful chaining capabilities makes it more strong. disadvantages: while jquery has an impressive library in terms of quantity, depending on how much customization you require on your website. the functionality may be limited thus using raw javascript may be inevitable in some cases. the jquery javascript file is required to run the commands, while the size of this file is relatively small (25-100kb depending on the server). it is still a strain on the client computer and maybe your web server as well if you intend to host the script on your own web server. learn more about jquery: introduction syntax design and implement calculator create an image slider design a tic-tac-toe game create a to-do list create followspot effect custom image magnifier design create a responsive image gallery create a simple map complete reference: selectors complete reference event methods complete reference effects complete reference html/css methods complete reference traversing complete reference ajax complete reference properties complete reference plugins complete reference questions questions asked in interview | interview questions and answers: set-1 set-2 set-3 recent articles on jquery please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. my personal notes arrow_drop_up save writing code in comment? please use ide.geeksforgeeks.org, generate link and share the link here. load comments comments old comments what's new geeks summer carnival 2022 view details data structures & algorithms- self paced course view details complete interview preparation view details most popular articles must do coding questions for product based companies python opencv - waitkey() function flutter - dropdownbutton widget appending to list in python dictionary how to redirect to another page in reactjs ? most visited articles basics of api testing using postman libraries in python how to set background images in reactjs ? how to remove duplicate elements from javascript array ? how to install jupyter notebook on macos? ? 5th floor, a-118, sector-136, noida, uttar pradesh - 201305 feedback@geeksforgeeks.org company about us careers in media contact us privacy policy copyright policy learn algorithms data structures sde cheat sheet machine learning cs subjects video tutorials news top news technology work & career business finance lifestyle languages python java cpp golang c# sql web development web tutorials django tutorial html css javascript bootstrap contribute write an article improve an article pick topics to write write interview experience internships video internship @geeksforgeeks , some rights reserved we use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website. by using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understood our cookie policy & privacy policy got it ! start your coding journey now! login register
