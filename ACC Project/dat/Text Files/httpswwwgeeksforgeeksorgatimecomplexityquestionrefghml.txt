assume that log(x) returns log value in base 2. c++ void fun() { int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) cout << "geeksforgeeks"; } // this code is contributed by shubhamsingh10. c void fun() { int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) printf("geeksforgeeks"); } java static void fun() { int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) system.out.printf("geeksforgeeks"); } // this code is contributed by umadevi9616 python3 import math def fun(): i = 0 j = 0 for i in range(1, n + 1): for j in range(1,math.log(i) + 1): print("geeksforgeeks") # this code is contributed by shubhamsingh10. c# static void fun() { int i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= log(i); j++) console.write("geeksforgeeks"); } // this code is contributed by umadevi9616 javascript const fun() { let i, j; for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) for (j = 1; j <= math.log(i); j++) document.write("geeksforgeeks"); } // this code is contributed by shubhamsingh10. time complexity of the above function can be written as ?(log 1) + ?(log 2) + ?(log 3) + . . . . + ?(log n) which is ?(log n!) order of growth of ?log n!? and ?n log n? is same for large values of n, i.e., ?(log n!) = ?(n log n). so time complexity of fun() is ?(n log n). the expression ?(log n!) = ?(n log n) can be easily derived from following stirling?s approximation (or stirling?s formula). log n! = n*log n - n = o(n*log(n)) please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stirling%27s_approximation my personal notes arrow_drop_up save like previous np-completeness | set 1 (introduction) next merge sort recommended articles page : time complexity and space complexity 11, jul 21 an interesting time complexity question 09, feb 15 time complexity of building a heap 28, may 11 time complexity where loop variable is incremented by 1, 2, 3, 4 .. 01, sep 15 time complexity of a loop when loop variable ?expands or shrinks?
