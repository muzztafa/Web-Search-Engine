mean? difficulty level : basic last updated : 24 sep, 2021 space complexity: the term space complexity is misused for auxiliary space at many places. following are the correct definitions of auxiliary space and space complexity. auxiliary space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm. space complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. space complexity includes both auxiliary space and space used by input. for example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then auxiliary space would be a better criterion than space complexity. merge sort uses o(n) auxiliary space, insertion sort, and heap sort use o(1) auxiliary space. the space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is o(n) though. space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. if we need to create an array of size n, this will require o(n) space. if we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require o(n2) space. in recursive calls stack space also counts. example : int add (int n){
    if (n <= 0){
        return 0;
    }
    return n + add (n-1);
}

here each call add a level to the stack :

1.  add(4)
2.    -> add(3)
3.      -> add(2)
4.        -> add(1)
5.          -> add(0)

each of these calls is added to call stack and takes up actual memory.
so it takes o(n) space. however, just because you have n calls total doesn?t mean it takes o(n) space. look at the below function : int addsequence (int n){
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        sum += pairsum(i, i+1);
    }
    return sum;
}

int pairsum(int x, int y){
    return x + y;
}

there will be roughly o(n) calls to pairsum. however, those 
calls do not exist simultaneously on the call stack,
so you only need o(1) space. note: it?s necessary to mention that space complexity depends on a variety of things such as the programming language, the compiler, or even the machine running the algorithm. please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. my personal notes arrow_drop_up save like previous analysis of algorithm | set 5 (amortized analysis introduction) next pseudo-polynomial algorithms recommended articles page : why does dijkstra's algorithm fail on negative weights? 12, aug 21 for each value in [1, n] find minimum element present in all subarray of that size 04, apr 22 types of complexity classes | p, np, conp, np hard and np complete 30, dec 21 count of arrays of size n with elements in range [0, (2^k)-1] having maximum sum & bitwise and 0 30, dec 21 computational complexity v/s chomsky hierarchy 15, oct 21 logarithmic vs double logarithmic time complexity 15, oct 21 why does dijkstra's algorithm fail on negative weights? 12, aug 21 miscellaneous problems of time complexity 01, aug 21 prune-and-search | a complexity analysis overview 19, jul 21 time complexity and space complexity 11, jul 21 analysis of algorithms | big - ?
