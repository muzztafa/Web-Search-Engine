unrolled linked list | set 1 (introduction) a programmer?s approach of looking at array vs. linked list how to write c functions that modify head pointer of a linked list? given a linked list which is sorted, how will you insert in sorted way can we reverse a linked list in less than o(n)? practice questions for linked list and recursion construct a maximum sum linked list out of two sorted linked lists having some common nodes given only a pointer to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you delete it?
