non-overlapping sum of two sets find elements which are present in first array and not in second check if two arrays are equal or not pair with given sum and maximum shortest distance from end pair with given product | set 1 (find if any pair exists) find missing elements of a range k-th missing element in increasing sequence which is not present in a given sequence find pair with greatest product in array minimum number of subsets with distinct elements remove minimum number of elements such that no common element exist in both arra count items common to both the lists but with different prices minimum index sum for common elements of two lists find pairs with given sum such that elements of pair are in different rows common elements in all rows of a given matrix find distinct elements common to all rows of a matrix find all permuted rows of a given row in a matrix change the array into a permutation of numbers from 1 to n count pairs with given sum count pairs from two sorted arrays whose sum is equal to a given value x count pairs from two linked lists whose sum is equal to a given value count quadruples from four sorted arrays whose sum is equal to a given value x number of subarrays having sum exactly equal to k count pairs whose products exist in array given two unsorted arrays, find all pairs whose sum is x frequency of each element in an unsorted array sort elements by frequency find pairs in array whose sums already exist in array find all pairs (a, b) in an array such that a % b = k convert an array to reduced form | set 1 (simple and hashing) return maximum occurring character in an input string group words with same set of characters second most repeated word in a sequence smallest element repeated exactly ?k? times (not limited to small range) numbers with prime frequencies greater than or equal to k find k numbers with most occurrences in the given array find the first repeating element in an array of integers find sum of non-repeating (distinct) elements in an array non-repeating element k-th distinct (or non-repeating) element in an array. print all distinct elements of a given integer array only integer with positive value in positive negative value in array pairs of positive negative values in an array intermediate : find itinerary from a given list of tickets find number of employees under every employee count divisible pairs in an array check if an array can be divided into pairs whose sum is divisible by k longest subarray with sum divisible by k subarray with no pair sum divisible by k print array elements that are divisible by at-least one other find three element from different three arrays such that that a + b + c = sum find four elements a, b, c and d in an array such that a+b = c+d find the largest subarray with 0 sum printing longest increasing consecutive subsequence longest increasing consecutive subsequence longest subsequence such that difference between adjacents is one | set 2 longest consecutive subsequence largest increasing subsequence of consecutive integers count subsets having distinct even numbers count distinct elements in every window of size k maximum possible sum of a window in an array such that elements of same window in other array are unique distributing items when a person cannot take more than two items of same type design a data structure that supports insert, delete, search and getrandom in constant time check if array contains contiguous integers with duplicates allowed length of the largest subarray with contiguous elements find if there is a subarray with 0 sum print all subarrays with 0 sum find subarray with given sum | set 2 (handles negative numbers) find four elements that sum to a given value implementing our own hash table with separate chaining in java implementing own hash table with open addressing linear probing in c++ vertical sum in a given binary tree group shifted string minimum insertions to form a palindrome with permutations allowed check for palindrome after every character replacement query maximum length subsequence with difference between adjacent elements as either 0 or 1 | set 2 maximum difference between frequency of two elements such that element having greater frequency is also greater difference between highest and least frequencies in an array maximum difference between first and last indexes of an element in array maximum possible difference of two subsets of an array sorting using trivial hash function smallest subarray with k distinct numbers longest subarray not having more then k distinct elements sum of f(a[i], a[j]) over all pairs in an array of n integers find number of pairs in an array such that their xor is 0 maximize elements using another array hard : clone a binary tree with random pointers largest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s longest subarray having count of 1s one more than count of 0s longest subarray having count of 1s one more than count of 0s count substrings with equal number of 0s, 1s and 2s print all triplets in sorted array that form ap all unique triplets that sum up to a given value find all triplets with zero sum count number of triplets with product equal to given number count of index pairs with equal elements in an array palindrome substring queries find smallest range containing elements from k lists range queries for frequencies of array elements elements to be added so that all elements of a range are present in array cuckoo hashing ? worst case o(1) lookup! subarrays with distinct elements count subarrays having total distinct elements same as original array count subarrays with same even and odd elements minimum number of distinct elements after removing m items distributing items when a person cannot take more than two items of same type maximum consecutive numbers present in an array maximum array from two given arrays keeping order same maximum number of chocolates to be distributed equally among k students find largest d in array such that a + b + c = d find sum of all unique sub-array sum for a given array. misc : advantages of bst over hash table internal working of hashmap in java hash table vs stl map recaman?s sequence c++ program for hashing with chaining largest subset whose all elements are fibonacci numbers pairs of amicable numbers find all duplicate subtrees hash table vs stl map find if there is a rectangle in binary matrix with corners as 1 maximum area rectangle by picking four sides from array root to leaf path with maximum distinct nodes game of replacing array elements length of longest strict bitonic subsequence last seen array element (last appearance is earliest) quick links : ?practice problems?
