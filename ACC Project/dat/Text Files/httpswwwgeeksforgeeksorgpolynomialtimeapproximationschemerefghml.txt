polynomial time approximation scheme (ptas) is a type of approximate algorithms that provide user to control over accuracy which is a desirable feature. these algorithms take an additional parameter ? > 0 and provide a solution that is (1 + ?) approximate for minimization and (1 ? ?) for maximization. for example consider a minimization problem, if ? is 0.5, then the solution provided by the ptas algorithm is 1.5 approximate. the running time of ptas must be polynomial in terms of n, however, it can be exponential in terms of ?. in ptas algorithms, the exponent of the polynomial can increase dramatically as ? reduces, for example if the runtime is o(n(1/?)!) which is a problem. there is a stricter scheme, fully polynomial time approximation scheme (fptas). in fptas, algorithm need to polynomial in both the problem size n and 1/?. example (0-1 knapsack problem): we know that 0-1 knapsack is np complete. there is a dp based pseudo polynomial solution for this. but if input values are high, then the solution becomes infeasible and there is a need of approximate solution. one approximate solution is to use greedy approach (compute value per kg for all items and put the highest value per kg first if it is smaller than w), but greedy approach is not ptas, so we don?t have control over accuracy. below is a fptas solution for 0-1 knapsack problem: input: w (capacity of knapsack) val[0..n-1] (values of items) wt[0..n-1] (weights of items) find the maximum valued item, i.e., find maximum value in val[]. let this maximum value be maxval. compute adjustment factor k for all values 
      k  = (maxval * ?) / n adjust all values, i.e., create a new array val'[] that values divided by k. do following for every value val[i]. 
      val'[i] = floor(val[i] / k) run dp based solution for reduced values, i,e, val'[0..n-1] and all other parameter same. the above solution works in polynomial time in terms of both n and ?. the solution provided by this fptas is (1 ? ?) approximate. the idea is to rounds off some of the least significant digits of values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/?. example: 
val[] = {12, 16, 4, 8}
wt[]  = {3, 4, 5, 2}
w = 10
? = 0.5
 
maxval = 16 [maximum value in val[]]
adjustment factor, k = (16 * 0.5)/4 = 2.0

now we apply dp based solution on below modified 
instance of problem.

val'[] = {6, 8, 2, 4}  [ val'[i] = floor(val[i]/k) ]
wt[] = {3, 4, 5, 2}
w = 10
 how is the solution (1 ? ?) * opt? here opt is the optimal value. let s be the set produced by above fptas algorithm and total value of s be val(s). we need to show that 
       val(s) >= (1 - ?)*opt let o be the set produced by optimal solution (the solution with total value opt), i.e., val(o) = opt. 
       val(o) - k*val'(o) <= n*k 
       [because val'[i] = floor(val[i]/k) ] after the dynamic programming step, we get a set that is optimal for the scaled instance and therefore must be at least as good as choosing the set o with the smaller profits. from that, we can conclude, 
      val'(s) >= k . val'(o)
              >= val(o) - nk
              >= opt - ? * maxval
              >= opt - ? * opt [opt >= maxval]
              >= (1 - ?) * opt sources: http://math.mit.edu/~goemans/18434s06/knapsack-katherine.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polynomial-time_approximation_scheme this article is contributed by dheeraj gupta. if you like geeksforgeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org. see your article appearing on the geeksforgeeks main page and help other geeks. please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above my personal notes arrow_drop_up save like previous amazon interview experience | set 247 (for sde 1) next bootstrap dropdowns and responsive tabs recommended articles page : approximation algorithms 15, jun 21 maximum removal from array when removal time >= waiting time 24, oct 18 count fibonacci numbers in given range in o(log n) time and o(1) space 15, jan 16 generating otp (one time password) in php 10, oct 18 finding median of unsorted array in linear time using c++ stl 16, jun 20 schedule elevator to reduce the total time taken 18, feb 19 count of sub-strings that do not contain all the characters from the set {'a', 'b', 'c'} at the same time 27, mar 19 microsoft interview experience for full time position of software engineer at microsoft ireland research 29, apr 19 algorithms sample questions | set 3 | time order analysis 27, may 19 construct the rooted tree by using start and finish time of its dfs traversal 11, jun 19 minimum time required to fill the entire matrix with 1's 30, apr 20 real time optimized kmp algorithm for pattern searching 22, may 20 how is the time complexity of sieve of eratosthenes is n*log(log(n))? 15, jan 20 akra-bazzi method for finding the time complexities 02, may 21 how to solve time complexity recurrence relations using recursion tree method? 19, jun 21 priority cpu scheduling with different arrival time - set 2 03, nov 17 time-space trade-off in algorithms 29, oct 20 queries of ncr%p in o(1) time complexity 10, jul 18 extended mo's algorithm with ? o(1) time complexity 26, jun 18 time complexity of euclidean algorithm 24, mar 21 article contributed by : geeksforgeeks vote for difficulty current difficulty : expert easy normal medium hard expert improved by : jokic07 shubhamagarwal0312 article tags : algorithms practice tags : algorithms report issue writing code in comment? please use ide.geeksforgeeks.org, generate link and share the link here. load comments comments old comments what's new dsa live classes for working professionals view details geeks summer carnival 2022 view details data structures & algorithms- self paced course view details most popular in algorithms sde sheet - a complete guide for sde preparation dsa sheet by love babbar difference between algorithm, pseudocode and program k-nearest neighbours difference between informed and uninformed search in ai more related articles in algorithms quadratic probing in hashing what are hash functions and how to choose a good hash function? lamport's logical clock binary search in javascript hash functions and list/types of hash functions ? 5th floor, a-118, sector-136, noida, uttar pradesh - 201305 feedback@geeksforgeeks.org company about us careers in media contact us privacy policy copyright policy learn algorithms data structures sde cheat sheet machine learning cs subjects video tutorials news top news technology work & career business finance lifestyle languages python java cpp golang c# sql web development web tutorials django tutorial html css javascript bootstrap contribute write an article improve an article pick topics to write write interview experience internships video internship @geeksforgeeks , some rights reserved we use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website. by using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understood our cookie policy & privacy policy got it ! start your coding journey now! login register
