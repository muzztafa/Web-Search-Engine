swap two nibbles in a byte how to turn off a particular bit in a number? russian peasant (multiply two numbers using bitwise operators) add two bit strings write your own strcmp that ignores cases check if two numbers are equal without using arithmetic and comparison operators find xor of two number without using xor operator more >> intermediate : swap bits in a given number little and big endian mystery smallest of three integers without comparison operators a boolean array puzzle compute the integer absolute value (abs) without branching compute the minimum or maximum of two integers without branching find the two non-repeating elements in an array of repeating elements write an efficient c program to reverse bits of a number smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n write a c program to find the parity of an unsigned integer swap all odd and even bits check if binary representation of a number is palindrome generate n-bit gray codes check if a given number is sparse or not euclid?s algorithm when % and / operations are costly find nth magic number how to swap two bits in a given integer? calculate square of a number without using *, / and pow() generate 0 and 1 with 25% and 75% probability find even occurring elements in an array of limited range cyclic redundancy check and modulo-2 division copy set bits in a range check if a number is bleak count strings with consecutive 1?s gray to binary and binary to gray conversion more >> hard : count total set bits in all numbers from 1 to n program to count number of set bits in an (big) array next higher number with same number of set bits karatsuba algorithm for fast multiplication find the maximum subarray xor in a given array inserting m into n such that m starts at bit j and ends at bit i find duplicates of array using bit array find longest sequence of 1?s in binary representation with one flip closest (or next) smaller and greater numbers with same number of set bits bitmasking and dynamic programming | set-2 (tsp) compute the parity of a number using xor and table look-up xor encryption by shifting plaintext count pairs in an array which have at least one digit common python program to convert floating to binary levelwise alternating or and xor operations in segment tree booth?s multiplication algorithm leftover element after performing alternate bitwise or and bitwise xor operations on adjacent pairs number of pairs with pandigital concatenation find the n-th number whose binary representation is a palindrome misc : interesting facts about bitwise operators in c optimization techniques | set 1 (modulus) what are the differences between bitwise and logical and operators in c/c++?
