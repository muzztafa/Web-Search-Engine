   for (int i = 1; i <= c; i++) {  
        // some o(1) expressions
   } 2) o(n): time complexity of a loop is considered as o(n) if the loop variables are incremented/decremented by a constant amount. for example following functions have o(n) time complexity.    // here c is a positive integer constant   
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {  
        // some o(1) expressions
   }

   for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= c) {
        // some o(1) expressions
   } 3) o(nc): time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. for example, the following sample loops have o(n2) time complexity   
   for (int i = 1; i <=n; i += c) {
       for (int j = 1; j <=n; j += c) {
          // some o(1) expressions
       }
   }

   for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= c) {
       for (int j = i+1; j <=n; j += c) {
          // some o(1) expressions
   } for example, selection sort and insertion sort have o(n2) time complexity. 4) o(logn) time complexity of a loop is considered as o(logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied by a constant amount.    for (int i = 1; i <=n; i *= c) {
       // some o(1) expressions
   }
   for (int i = n; i > 0; i /= c) {
       // some o(1) expressions
   } for example, binary search(refer iterative implementation) has o(logn) time complexity. let us see mathematically how it is o(log n). the series that we get in the first loop is 1, c, c2, c3, ? ck. if we put k equals to logcn, we get clogcn which is n. 5) o(loglogn) time complexity of a loop is considered as o(loglogn) if the loop variables are reduced/increased exponentially by a constant amount.    // here c is a constant greater than 1   
   for (int i = 2; i <=n; i = pow(i, c)) { 
       // some o(1) expressions
   }
   //here fun is sqrt or cuberoot or any other constant root
   for (int i = n; i > 1; i = fun(i)) { 
       // some o(1) expressions
   } see this for mathematical details. how to combine the time complexities of consecutive loops? when there are consecutive loops, we calculate time complexity as a sum of time complexities of individual loops.    for (int i = 1; i <=m; i += c) {  
        // some o(1) expressions
   }
   for (int i = 1; i <=n; i += c) {
        // some o(1) expressions
   }
   time complexity of above code is o(m) + o(n) which is o(m+n)
   if m == n, the time complexity becomes o(2n) which is o(n).   how to calculate time complexity when there are many if, else statements inside loops? as discussed here, worst-case time complexity is the most useful among best, average and worst. therefore we need to consider the worst case. we evaluate the situation when values in if-else conditions cause a maximum number of statements to be executed. for example, consider the linear search function where we consider the case when an element is present at the end or not present at all. when the code is too complex to consider all if-else cases, we can get an upper bound by ignoring if-else and other complex control statements. how to calculate the time complexity of recursive functions? the time complexity of a recursive function can be written as a mathematical recurrence relation. to calculate time complexity, we must know how to solve recurrences. we will soon be discussing recurrence solving techniques as a separate post. quiz on analysis of algorithms next ? analysis of algorithm | set 4 (solving recurrences) please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. my personal notes arrow_drop_up save like previous lower and upper bound theory next analysis of algorithm | set 4 (solving recurrences) recommended articles page : analysis of algorithms | set 1 (asymptotic analysis) 03, jan 12 analysis of algorithms | big-o analysis 28, feb 18 analysis of algorithm | set 5 (amortized analysis introduction) 23, sep 14 algorithms sample questions | set 3 | time order analysis 27, may 19 analysis of algorithms | set 3 (asymptotic notations) 26, oct 13 analysis of algorithms | set 2 (worst, average and best cases) 19, feb 12 analysis of algorithms | set 5 (practice problems) 02, may 17 performance of loops (a caching question) 30, aug 15 asymptotic analysis and comparison of sorting algorithms 28, dec 16 analysis of algorithms | little o and little omega notations 14, aug 17 analysis of algorithms | big - ?
