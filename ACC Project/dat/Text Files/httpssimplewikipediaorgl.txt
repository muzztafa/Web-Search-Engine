It does not mean readers want basic information. Articles do not have to be short to be simple; expand articles, add details, but use basic vocabulary. Be bold! Your article does not have to be perfect, because other editors will fix it and make it better. And most importantly, do not be afraid to start and make articles better yourself. Selected article Evolution is a scientific theory used by biologists. It explains how animals and plants changed over a long time, and how they have come to be the way they are. Earth is very old, about 4.5 billion years. By studying the layers of rock that make up Earth's crust, scientists can find out about its past. This kind of research is called historical geology. We know that living things have changed over time, because we can see their remains in the rocks. These remains are called 'fossils'. So we know that the animals and plants of today are different from those of long ago. And the further we go back, the more different the fossils are. How has this come about? Evolution has taken place. That evolution has taken place is a fact, because it is overwhelmingly supported by many lines of evidence. At the same time, evolutionary questions are still being actively researched by biologists. The theory of evolution is the basis of modern biology. Nothing in biology makes sense without it. more...
