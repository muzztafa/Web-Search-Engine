self paced course . the course is designed for all the curious coders out there who have just kickstarted their journey into the insightful world of computer science and built strong fundamentals in one of the most prominent languages in the computer world. recent articles on c ! c output & multiple choice questions basics, variable declaration, definition and scope, data types, storage classes, input/output, operators, preprocessor, array & strings, control statements, functions, pointers, enum, struct and union, memory management, file handling, puzzles, misc, c language interview questions, multiple choice questions basics: c language introduction c programming language standard int (1 sign bit + 31 data bits) keyword in c is it fine to write ?void main()?
