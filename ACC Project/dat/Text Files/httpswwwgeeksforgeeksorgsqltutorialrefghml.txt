models database design(normal forms) sql transactions and concurrency control file structures (sequential files, indexing, b and b+ trees) sql tutorial last updated : 28 mar, 2022 structured query language or sql is a standard database language which is used to create, maintain and retrieve the data from relational databases like mysql, oracle, sql server, postgre, etc. the recent iso standard version of sql is sql:2019. as the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). all databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use sql, are called nosql databases. examples of nosql are mongodb, dynamodb, cassandra, etc related courses: sql or structured query language is the most significant language to learn for getting a job in data analysis or data sciences. anyone with an interest to learn sql can join this course! now opt for this sql foundation ? self paced course from anywhere in the world, at any time and learn the fundamentals of sql with a deep understanding of the topics from industry experts. start your sql journey today! ?recent articles? on sql topic: basics clauses /
