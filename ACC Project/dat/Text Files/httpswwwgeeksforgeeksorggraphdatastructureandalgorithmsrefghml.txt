a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. the nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. more formally a graph can be defined as, a graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of edges which connect a pair of nodes. in the above graph, the set of vertices v = {0,1,2,3,4} and the set of edges e = {01, 12, 23, 34, 04, 14, 13}. graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. graphs are used to represent networks. the networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. graphs are also used in social networks like linkedin, facebook. for example, in facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc. topics: introduction, dfs and bfs graph cycle topological sorting minimum spanning tree backtracking shortest paths connectivity maximum flow stl
