self paced course , which will help you strengthen your java basics concepts like, data types, operators, functions, loops & much more. the java collections framework is a collection of classes, interfaces, and methods that provides us with data structures including linkedlist, arraylist, hashmap, and others. anyone with a basic understanding of data structures and java foundations can enrol in fundamentals of java collection framework ? self paced course and enhance their programming skills. simple hello world program : 
// a java program to print "hello world" 
public class gfg { 
    public static void main(string args[]) 
    { 
        system.out.println("hello world"); 
    } 
}
