/* echo is a print command */
echo "hello world!"; 

?> 
 output: hello world! why we learn php ? it is one of the widely used open-source general-purpose scripting language that is used for backend development. apart from this, let?s see why we should learn it. easy to learn: it is easier to learn for anyone who has come across to any programming language for the first time. free of cost: since it is an open-source language, therefore developers are allowed to use its components and all methods for free. flexible: since it is a dynamically typed language, therefore there are no hard rules on how to build features using it. supports nearly all databases: it supports all the widely used databases, including mysql, odbc, sqlite etc. secured: it has multiple security levels provides us a secure platform for developing websites as it has multiple security levels. huge community support: it is loved and used by a huge number of developers. the developers share their knowledge with other people of the community that want to know about it. learn more about php: introduction advantages and disadvantages connect php to mysql form processing build a grocery store web app using php with mysql how to insert form data into database ? how to upload image into database and display it ? create a signup form using php and mysql database generating a qr code dynamically functions complete references: array functions complete reference string functions complete reference math functions complete reference gmp functions complete reference calendar functions complete reference intlchar functions complete reference imagick functions complete reference gmagick functions complete reference imagickdraw functions complete reference image processing and gd functions complete reference spl data structures complete reference ds\sequence functions complete reference ds\vector functions complete reference ds\deque functions complete reference ds\map functions complete reference ds\set functions complete reference ds\stack functions complete reference ds\queue functions complete reference ds\priorityqueue functions complete reference filesystem functions complete reference interview questions and answers: set-1 set-2 programming examples recent articles on php please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. my personal notes arrow_drop_up save writing code in comment? please use ide.geeksforgeeks.org, generate link and share the link here. load comments comments old comments what's new geeks summer carnival 2022 view details data structures & algorithms- self paced course view details complete interview preparation view details most popular articles must do coding questions for product based companies python opencv - waitkey() function flutter - dropdownbutton widget appending to list in python dictionary how to redirect to another page in reactjs ? most visited articles basics of api testing using postman libraries in python how to set background images in reactjs ? how to remove duplicate elements from javascript array ? how to install jupyter notebook on macos? ? 5th floor, a-118, sector-136, noida, uttar pradesh - 201305 feedback@geeksforgeeks.org company about us careers in media contact us privacy policy copyright policy learn algorithms data structures sde cheat sheet machine learning cs subjects video tutorials news top news technology work & career business finance lifestyle languages python java cpp golang c# sql web development web tutorials django tutorial html css javascript bootstrap contribute write an article improve an article pick topics to write write interview experience internships video internship @geeksforgeeks , some rights reserved we use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website. by using our site, you acknowledge that you have read and understood our cookie policy & privacy policy got it ! start your coding journey now! login register
