Founded and edited by John Neal (pictured), it was published in Portland, Maine, between 1828 and 1829. The magazine helped establish the American gymnastics movement, covered national politics, and critiqued American literature, art, theater, and social issues.

Essays by Neal on American art and theater anticipated major changes and movements realized in the following decades. His articles on women's rights and early feminist ideas affirmed intellectual equality between men and women and demanded political and economic rights for women, saying "If woman would act with woman, there would be a stop to our tyranny".
